# Created a basic project in React
A URL-Shortener is a basic project which shorts any website link into 8-character id and by accessing that shortId we wil be redirected to the original website address.
## Steps to use the project:
Clone the repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/Arpan-21/URL-shortener.git
```
Install all packages using:
```
npm install
```
Run the code on local environment:
```
npm start
```
If you want your responses to be stored to your MongoDB database then create the database on the atlas by signing into your account. After doing this copy your connect code which will be like :
```
mongodb+srv://<user_name>:<password>@cluster0.rwe3tdo.mongodb.net/
```

## Good work!! Your project has been created now you can create your own UI and just integrate this functionality into that.
